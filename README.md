# SimonGame
A color sequencing game built with jQuery, where the user gets to next level by reconstructing the color sequences displayed by the game.

Features:
• Dealed with the cases of game start, game over and game restart.\n
• Realizes and adapts to level changes.\n
• Adds animation and sounds when a button gets pressed or displayed by the game.\n
I implemented all these features with jQuery.
