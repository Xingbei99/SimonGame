# SimonGame - A front end web application built with jQuery
A color sequencing game built with jQuery, where the user gets to next level by reconstructing the color sequences displayed by the game.

Rules: https://www.ultraboardgames.com/simon/game-rules.php#:~:text=Press%20the%20START%20button.,player%20with%20that%20color%20repeats.

Playing the game: https://xingbei99.github.io/SimonGame/

Features:

• Handles the cases of game start, game over and game restart.

• Checks if the user rebuilds the given pattern through button clicks.

• Realizes and adapts to level changes.

• Adds animation and sounds!

In this project, I was responsible for implementing all these features with jQuery in game.js.
