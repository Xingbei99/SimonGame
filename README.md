# SimonGame
A color sequencing game built with jQuery, where the user gets to next level by reconstructing the color sequences displayed by the game.

Features:
• Handles the cases of game start, game over and game restart.
• Checks if the user rebuilds the given pattern through button clicks.
• Realizes and adapts to level changes.
• Adds animation and sounds when a button gets pressed or displayed by the game.
I implemented all these features with jQuery.
